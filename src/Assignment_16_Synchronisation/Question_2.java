    /*
    synchronized block: It is used to synchronize a block of code, allowing only one thread to execute the synchronized code at a time. The lock is acquired on the object that the synchronized block is synchronized on.

synchronized method: It is used to synchronize an entire method, allowing only one thread to execute the method at a time. The lock is acquired on the object that the method is called on.

ReentrantLock: It is a class that provides a reentrant lock that can be used to synchronize code. It allows a thread to acquire the lock multiple times, as long as the same thread is releasing the lock each time.

ReadWriteLock: It is a class that provides a read-write lock. Multiple threads can hold the read lock at the same time, but only one thread can hold the write lock at a time.

Semaphore: It is a class that provides a way to limit the number of threads that can access a shared resource at a time. A semaphore maintains a set of permits, and a thread must acquire a permit before accessing the shared resource.

CountDownLatch: It is a class that provides a way to synchronize multiple threads by waiting for them to complete. It allows one or more threads to wait for a set of operations to complete before proceeding.

CyclicBarrier: It is a class that provides a way to synchronize multiple threads by allowing them to wait for each other to reach a common barrier point. Once all the threads have reached the barrier point, they can proceed.
